"""What the public support tiers mean, declared once.

Each data source is placed in one of three public tiers by the criteria it meets. This module
is the only place that states which declarations satisfy each criterion and which combination
of criteria yields each tier. Tier placement and the per-row display of criteria both read it,
so a row's tier and the criteria shown beside it cannot disagree.

Principles the declarations below encode:

* Tier names do not reuse the names of the declarations behind them. The top tier is a
  conjunction of two criteria and no single declaration names a conjunction, so printing a
  declaration name would imply a correspondence that cannot exist.
* The lowest tier asserts nothing about who wrote or maintains a connection path. Most paths in
  it are maintained in the shipped package.
* The datasource API criterion is a claim about managing a data source, made with connection
  testing neutralized. It says nothing about whether expectations run, so it is displayed but
  never lifts a row out of the lowest tier.
* The full-gallery criterion without the datasource API criterion is the middle tier. Such a
  data source has passed every expectation the shipped package registers, which is more than the
  middle tier asks for; placing it lowest because it lacks a criterion about managing a data
  source would understate it. No record produces that combination today, and the mapping is
  specified over every combination anyway: a mapping correct only for the combinations that
  happen to occur is wrong the first time one changes.
* A declaration no criterion names is legal and silent. Rows are unaffected by it.
* A row is one public name, which several records may share. A criterion is met by a row only
  when every record under that name declares it, so one tested variant cannot advertise coverage
  for an untested sibling. A declared continuous-integration lane is evidence of nothing: it
  means dependencies are installed and something runs, whereas a tier means a suite passes.
