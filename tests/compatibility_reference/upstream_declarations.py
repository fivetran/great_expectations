"""The single read surface for every declaration the compatibility reference takes from elsewhere.

The data-source records, the fluent suite's per-type case exclusions and its two published
coverage literals are owned by other modules. This one imports them, resolves them, and returns
them (``SupportTier``, the enumeration of declarations a record can make, is re-exported for the
same reason); it decides nothing about what a declaration means, so a reader auditing an upstream
contract reads this file and no other.

Two things are declared here because no upstream field carries them, and each is checked against
the declarations it describes so it cannot silently go stale:

* ``CONNECTION_PATH_DESCRIPTIONS`` -- a user-facing phrase for every registered fluent datasource
  type. A harness label is internal, a public name is shared by every variant of one data source
  by definition, and a fluent type literal is an internal identifier, so none of them can name a
  variant to a reader. Loading fails if a record declares a type the map does not describe, or if
  the pinned list of uncovered paths names one it does not describe, rather than printing an
  identifier.
* ``TESTED_VERSION_NOTES`` -- the version of a data source a continuous-integration lane attests
  to. No record field carries that. Loading fails if a key names no published row, or names a data
  source whose records do not all declare a lane: a version claim with no lane behind it is a
  hand-maintained assertion nothing verifies.

Records are read through the registry's accessor at call time. The registry package also exposes
lists built once when their module is first imported; those omit any record registered afterwards
and are deliberately not used here.
