    "A single character that removes the special meaning of the `_` and `%` wildcards "
    "that follow it in the like pattern, emitted as a SQL `ESCAPE` clause. Required to "
    "match those characters literally: dialects disagree about an unannounced backslash "
    "(PostgreSQL treats it as an escape, SQLite treats it as an ordinary character, and "
    "Snowflake requires the clause to be stated), so a pattern relying on the default is "
    "not portable. Prefer a character other than a backslash: several dialects also treat "
    "a backslash specially inside string literals, before the pattern reaches LIKE, and "
    "Redshift rejects `ESCAPE '\\'` outright. Omit it to emit no `ESCAPE` clause. Not "
    "supported on BigQuery, whose GoogleSQL has no `ESCAPE` clause: escape wildcards "
    "inside the pattern there instead."
